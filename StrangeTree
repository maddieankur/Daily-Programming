/*
Question is Based Upon Complete Binary Tree Have all nodes continuos Increasing integer , Root value is 0

There are comma Separated input Given : Input Have three value: left,right, Any

Any can be itself,left and right

Find all the sum of all the combination of Input: 


suppose:


            1
      2           3
  4     5      6     7
8  9  10 11   12 13 14 15

if Input is left,right,left :

Ans is : 2+5+10 = 17

if Input is left,Any,left:
then 3 possible Case:
  left,left,left = 2+4+8 = 14
  left,right,left = 2+5+10 = 17
  left,itself,left = 2+2+4 = 8
  
  Total = 14+17+8 = 39
  
  
  
  Can be Solved By recursion by Passing Parameter the current value , & Possible choice and next= current+1

*/

if current is left:
  solve(currValue,left,next = current+1)
if current is right:
  solve(currValue,right,next = current+1)
if current is Any:
  solve(currValue,left,next) 
  solve(currValue,right,next)
  solve(currValue,current,next)
